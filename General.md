# 1. Set Up a Virtual Environment
    Virtual environments allow you to isolate dependencies for different projects.
# 1.1 Create a Virtual Environment
    'python -m venv myenv'     # You can replace "myenv" with any name you prefer
# 1.2 Activate the Virtual Environment: 
    . On Windows:
        '.venv\Scripts\activate'
    . On macOS/Linux:
        ' source venv/bin/activate'
    You should see the environment name in your terminal prompt.
    Now, within your virtual environment, you can install Python packages using pip:
    ' pip install package_name'
